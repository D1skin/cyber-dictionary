ZTNA used to provide secure access to private applications without allowing users to access the whole enterprise network. They are often described as a replacement for traditional technologies like VPN, and introduce various methods of authentication to remain identity and context aware of users who are accessing enterprise applications. ZTNA solution types include self-hosted, from the cloud and self-managed or as and cloud fully managed.
